# House Plant Tracker
Database project designed to help better my understanding of the C language, file I/O, and my wife's house plants. This project is the starting point of a long term goal to automate watering all our plants using a raspberry pi as the microcontroller.

Run `make` command to build the program and run initial test line that will populate a newly created `mydb.db` file. 
After using the make command, run `bin/dbview -h` to see all possible commands for the program and hope you like it :)
